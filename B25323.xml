         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>FEars and Jealouſies</hi> are of all other <hi>Paſſions</hi> the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be <hi>ſubdued,</hi> and where they are <hi>perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only,</hi> for accompliſhing ſome <hi>Siniſter end,</hi> they are not to be removed by <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> Since they who are once Poſſeſſed with them, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yield till they deſpair of attaining, or effecting the <hi>ends</hi> they aim at.</p>
            <p>All that I can hope to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb facs="tcp:199337:3"/>by this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> is to give <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> to thoſe who are <hi>ſcrupulous in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,</hi> and by the peruſing of <hi>Partial Authors</hi> dread the loſs of their <hi>Church-lands,</hi> and the <hi>diminiſhing</hi> their <hi>Eſtates</hi> thereby.</p>
            <p>To ſuch only I direct this Diſcourſe; and can further <hi>tell</hi> them, that their <hi>Fears</hi> are wholly <hi>Groundleſs;</hi> ſince His <hi>Majeſty</hi> by His <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Command</hi> appointed the Author to compoſe this for the <hi>Quieting</hi> the minds of His <hi>Intereſſed Subjects,</hi> Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing to them the <hi>Full Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance</hi> of their <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> by the <hi>Canon, Civil</hi> and <hi>Municipal Laws,</hi> which to
<pb facs="tcp:199337:3"/>all <hi>conſiderate</hi> Perſons, it is hoped, will be ſufficient <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt own the <hi>Subject</hi> is of that moment, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to have been Treated of by an abler Pen, and one better skilled in the Laws: But I have endeavored, with a ſincerity becoming one that hates Impoſing, to clear both matter of <hi>Law and Fact.</hi>

               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:199337:37"/>
               <p>But here was a total ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Abolition of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Orders, under pretext that they had degenerated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sloth, Vice, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and that their Lands being given to the Crown, would ſo Augment the Kings Revenue, as the Subjects, for the future, would be eaſed of Subſidies, and other Taxes; the King might erect new Biſhopricks, and imploy ſome of their Lands to better Religious Uſes; which were the popular Arguments to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Aſſent of the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament to their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
               <p>Yet for want of appointing how particularly theſe Lands ſhould be applyed to ſuch uſes, and the abſolute Inveſting them in the Crown, without Limitation of Uſes, they were ſquandred away by piece-meal, and the Subjects very little

               <p>You further add, that when you conſider theſe things, and the Artifices uſed to obtain ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renders from the Convents of theſe Lands, and then make them paſs for their voluntary Acts, and as ſuch obtain their confirmation by Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo that in no Kingdom or State, any ſuch unpreſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Innovation upon the Rights of the Church, or ſuch a ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing devaſtation of theſe Lands, ſo legally ſettled upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious was ever known: You cannot conceive, but that if the Roman Catholic Religion can ever be Introduced here, thoſe Lands will be claimed and in Juſtice ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; Since no defence can be made for ſo violent a poſſeſſion of them.</p>

                  <hi>Burnets</hi> Arguments, That Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi>'s Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was an Artifice, and the Point was carried by thoſe who did not underſtand the true danger their Eſtates were in: But conſidered the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:199337:50"/>Advantages they were to have from the conſenting to the Act.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon he gives for this Aſſertion is, becauſe the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal gave a charge to all to be afraid of the Judgment of God that fell on <hi>Balthazar</hi> for converting the Holy Veſſels, which had been taken by his Father, and not by himſelf, to profane uſes; which, ſaith the Doctor, was to pardon the thing, and yet call it Sacrilege; and that it was ſtudiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to poſſeſs the People with an opinion of the ſin of retaining Church-lands, ſo that the Confirmation might be looked upon as an Indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Permiſſion to keep them, rather than a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Poſſeſſors had a Lawful Title.</p>
               <p>This you enforce from the Authority of<note n="(b)" place="margin">Letter to Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi>

               </q>
               <p>By this Journal it appears, that the Reconciliation was firſt performed, before the Bill for the ſecuring of Abby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands was perfected in the Houſes: So that all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:199337:79"/>of both Houſes being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, in the Name of the whole Realm, there could be no Objection againſt their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualifiedneſs by any Church Cenſures, to paſs that Bill, which is of no ſmall moment to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>Whence you may Judge concerning what Mr.<note n="(l)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Fox</hi> Writes, That about the time of the Abſolution, <hi>a Meſſenger was ſent from the Parliament to the Pope, to deſire him to Eſtabliſh the Sale of Abby and Chantry Lands; for the Lords and the Parliament would grant nothing on the Popes behalf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Purchaſes were well ſecured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to a Meſſengers ſending, no doubt ſeveral diſpatches, were made to and from <hi>Rome</hi> during this Tranſaction, but I cannot conceive that in ſo ſhort a time a Currier could go and come from <hi>Rome,</hi> and bring
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:199337:80"/>new Powers to the Cardinal, yet I will not inſiſt upon that.</p>
               <p>But I believe he Writes truly, that what preparation ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was made, by Debates, Conferences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> concerning the Repeal of other Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> they never paſſed into Bills, till the Bill for ſecuring Religious Lands was perfected.</p>
               <p>Hence we may conclude the Reaſon why the Solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, related in Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> was not till the 25th. of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> after this Parliament was Diſſolved, which was on the 16th. of the ſame Month, which Proceſſion,<note n="(m)" place="margin">Hiſt.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:199337:102"/>&amp; ultra, an poſſet moleſtari?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After he hath argued in the negative, he thus determins it. <hi>Quod ſi Papa ex certa ſcientiâ, de novo concederet Invaſori, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſa habita mentione Intruſionis &amp; violentiae, videtur illam vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiam remittere, &amp; de novo conferre, nec obſtat quod violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ſemper poteſt moleſtari.

               </p>
               <p>The ſumm of which is, that it being queſtioned whether a violent Poſſeſſor of Church-lands,<note place="margin">A vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder may be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with by the Pope.</note> deſiring of the Pope to confirm him in his Benefices, obtained by force, and the Pope do it, and after the Intruder Poſſeſs it for three Years or more, whether ſuch an one can be moleſted, <hi>viz.</hi> Ejected by courſe of Law?</p>
               <p>His anſwer is, that if the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:199337:103"/>Pope on his certain knowledg grant the ſame anew to the Intruder, and violent Poſſeſſor, it ſeems the violence is remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the thing is granted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new. Neither, ſaith he, doth the General Rule hold good in this caſe, that the violent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder may always be moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For that is only true where the violence is not purged, but here the violence is purged by obtaining the Popes Grant; therefore he is no more to be called a violent Poſſeſſor or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder, which, ſaith he, is to be noted.
